                <p>This is a space I've created where I will share my work and experiences in tech. But before that, about me, I am  a tech enthusiast who enjoys writing code and developing software; actively working towards achieving my goal, which is building technologies and systems that serve to better the quality of life of the people that use them. I enjoy solving problems, more so those that require and pick my technical skills. These involve developing software, network and cyber security solutions. </p>
                <p>So buckle up as I we will go on a ride as I share my coding journey where I will be solving problems and building fun side projects.</p>
